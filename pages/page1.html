    <h3>Rengoku vs Toji</h3>
    <div class="img3"><img src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2023/07/cfa3b-16886779696809-1920.jpg" width=95%" alt="demon slayer x jjk"></div>
    <p>After watching two senin anime - jjk and bleach, I start thinking what verses is stronger. Of course the biggest part of readers will say that is jjk. And yea, Gojo with infinity and Sukuna with his abilities can easily destroy the whole demon slayer verse. In that case, I decided to compare Toji and Rengoku. In my opinion it would fair fight without unbalanced abilities. I'll compare the main attributes like strength, speed, durability and so on. So, let's start with strength!</p>

    <h2>Strength comparison</h2>
    <div class="img3"><img src="https://media.tenor.com/seYv-syDnSEAAAAC/naruto-attack-punch-naruto-punch.gif" width="95%" alt="example1"></div>
    <p>This first comparison not difficult as we remember that even just nps in jjk  can fill a car that weighs several tons. And I repeat that's just a begging of their power. I may suggest that Toji easily can lift more than 10 tons. Moreover, Toji killed Dagon’s True Form in his own Domain Expansion. Megumi thinks that none of his Shikigami, possibly including Mahoraga, are a match for him. Said to be, like an Unrestricted Maki, capable of defeating the entire Zenin Clan)<br><br> In demon slayer even Gyomei the strongest hashira can lift only about 1-5 ton at max. As you can guess Rengoku is much weaker than him and so his max strength potential is about 1 or 2-3 tons at the best.<br><br>Overall, here the point take Toji with low-mid difficulty.</p>

    <h2>Speed comparison</h2>
    <div class="img3"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/7b/59/5c7b597c402c8c13e05b4026c7427b18.gif" width="95%" alt="example2"></div>
    <p>With speed, it would be much more interesting as both of them has their feats. I'll start with Rengoku. He's not fastest among hashiras but still his speed surprise me at the first time. In battle with Akaza, Tanjiro with their team can't even see his movements. In addition, he can run even faster than train and causes flames between him while running. Rengoku also can just speed blitz all demons who weaker than 6 upper moons. Assuming the height of the take-off and landing points are the same, Rengoku jumped off the train at a 59-degree angle and at 128 km/h speed. After 3.1 seconds, he should reach 47m altitude, then touch the ground 3.1 secs later. From the surroundings, the train was estimated to be travelling at around 60 km/h. So Rengoku landing speed would be 127 km/h. Based on the author’s calculation of high school students’ average vertical jump record, “the take-off speed is almost half the average speed of the 50 m run”. Whoever can jump at 128 km/h can run twice that speed. That means Rengoku can run at least 256 km/h or 72 m/s. As such, Rengoku runs with “total concentration” at a 256 km/h speed… That’s as fast as a bullet train!! Meanwhile, the Speed Demon is estimated to have a speed of 100 km/h, about the same as the steam locomotive used at the time, shown in the animation.<br><br>What about Toji? At the first appearance he was faster than teen Gojo. Toji showed him absolutely domination in terms of speed. In the second appearance, Toji is so fast that he could run on water like it was nothing, shocking the special grade Dagon who could keep up with Nanami and Maki (which is faster than a bullet), Scared Naobito who is stated to be the second-fastest Sorcerer. The upper limit can be considered the speed of sound in water (1.5 kilometers per second). If you run at this speed, then the water behaves like a solid body, and you can push off from it and run. In that case Toji have at least 1500 m/s or 5 mach speed <br><br>As you can see, even if we multiply Rengoku speed by 2-3 times in his full potential, he stills 5 times slower than Toji. Toji again take point with no difficulty</p>

    <h2>Durability</h2>
    <div class="img3"><img src="https://dailyanimeart.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/sasuke-blocks-using-susanoo.jpg?w=730" width="95%" alt="example3"></div>
    <p>Honestly, both of them have low level of durability. Toji have an ordinary human durability. Huge muscles are his only defense. Rengoku can control his breathing and manipulate his blood. He also wears a protective uniform. So, in this durability comparison Rengoku win with mid-difficulty</p>


    <h2>IQ and BIQ</h2>
    <div class="img3"><img src="https://media.tenor.com/iy3BeNI_mIAAAAAC/aizen-aizen-sosuke.gif" width="95%" alt="example4"></div>
    <p>In terms of iq they both hasn't any cool feats. I would say that here should be a draw<br><br>With biq Toji easily take this point as he is killer. Of course, Rengoku has also good biq but Toji still slam him here with low difficulty.</p>


    <h2>Abilities and Hax</h2>
    <div class="img3"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/83/85/46/838546ec7d2352266b860764d8b5ece0.gif" width="95%" alt="example5"></div>
    <p>Toji doesn't have any special abilities and Rengoku have flame breathing and maybe even can use fire for attacks. So this point take Flame Hashira. But hax definitely go to the Toji as he has 1st class of curses weapon. Plus he can use some curse technics</p>


    <h2>Overall Winner - Toji Furnishings</h2>
