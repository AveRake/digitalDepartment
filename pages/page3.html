    <h3>Gojo Satoru analysis</h3>
    <div class="img3"><img src="../img/gojo-satoru-jujutsu-kaisen.gif" width=95%" alt="Gojo-Satoru"></div>
    <p>Satoru Gojo (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies.<br>Satoru is a very tall, lean and muscular man who is in his late twenties and is considered relatively attractive, mainly due to his facial features. He has snow-white hair and the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru normally covers his eyes with a black blindfold which props up his hair and gives it a spikier appearance. When sporting a more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses and let his hair down to reach the base of his neck.<br>Satoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. His opinion of others often only go as far as his judgement of their strength, and he is quite apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he is very arrogant. He is convinced that he is the strongest in the world, which he technically is, claiming, during his fight with Toji Fushiguro, that "throughout the Heavens and earth, he alone is the honored one." This can be further exemplified when he was tasked with protecting Riko Amanai, one of the few 'weak' people he genuinely grew to show compassion for. However, any empathy of her death was soon negated by his extensive amount of pride and arrogance after perfecting his reverse cursed technique in his following battle against Toji Fushiguro.</p>


    <h2>Is Gojo similar to Kakashi? from Naruto</h2>
    <div class="img3"><img src="../img/e1wt0frckhb61.jpg" width=95%" alt="Gojo-Satoru"></div>
    <p>A character that fans love deeply in the Jujutsu Kaisen fandom is Gojo Satoru. The blindfolded man is strong and smart. Well, he is also extremely goofy, but we can’t deny his impact on the story. Rather than being a side character, he is almost a protagonist.<br><br>

        Ever since Jujutsu Kaisen and Gojo made their way into the light, the community has been convinced about one thing; Naruto’s Kakashi is the inspiration for Gojo Satoru.<br><br>

        It wouldn’t have been a surprise if Gojo actually was a homage to the legendary character. Gege Akutami has made a few references in the manga before. Even the anime has made many pop-culture references in its episodes.<br><br>

        So, Gojo and Kakashi have many similarities for being a coincidence. At first sight itself, nobody can miss their biggest similarity. Their appearances are very akin to each other, with white hair. Not only that, but they also have eyes covered (if one eye counts, that is).<br><br>

        Talking about eyes, both Kakashi and Gojo share another thing. They have unique powers related to the eyes. While the Sharingan and the Six-Eyes technique are different, they are also the identifying feature for Kakashi and Gojo. They are also the teachers of the protagonists.<br><br>

        According to the Jujutsu Kaisen fanbook, Tobitake Tonbo is the inspiration behind Jujutsu Kaisen’s Gojo Satoru.<br><br>

        Tobitake Tonbo is a literal unknown in Naruto. There is not much information on his powers. So, where do the similarities kick in?<br><br>

        Tonbo and Gojo both have their eyes fully covered, with Tonbo’s eyes covered with bandages. And as manga readers would know, Gojo’s eyes were covered with bandages earlier too. In fact, Gege made a switch to blindfold for the sake of simplicity!<br><br>

        The similarity doesn’t end there. Tonbo gives off a calm and collected appearance at the first go. He is also very confident in his abilities but doesn’t shy away from acknowledging others’. Sound familiar? Gojo’s personality is quite similar to this! He is sure he can beat Sukuna, but he also takes in students who can be his equals someday.<br><br>

        Both Tonbo and Gojo are also known for being incredibly fast and strong. Tonbo is also rash and quick-tempered, but we haven’t seen Gojo do that. YET. Hmm…do we smell a foreshadow here?</p>


    <h2>Why Gojo is a copy of Urahara from bleach?</h2>
    <div class="img3"><img src="../img/8406903-okd.jpeg" width=95%" alt="Gojo-Satoru"></div>
    <p>There was a thread recently talking about how a particular shot of Gojo in the anime looked perfect. The one where he tells Megumi regardless of the situation on the battlefield 'You die alone' with just one eye showing, and I couldn't put my finger on why it felt so familiar. Then it hit me - Urahara. His character had similar mentoring moments with Ichigo. Their character personalities are kind of similar too, how you've pointed out. The goof persona covers their actual strength, they're both smart and are mentors to the protagonists.<br><br> There are also definitive differences though, and they're both great characters with their own motivations. From the fanbook interview with Kubo I think Gege said he wanted to create a character like Kenpachi but realized Gojo didn't quite fit that mould in the end, so he ended up creating Todo. Gege is a huge Bleach fan, and it's nice to see some creative inspirations formed from it.

    <h2>What the result of our analysis and comparing?</h2>
    <div class="img3"><img src="../img/tumblr_0d87cfcec2f5db2aace2750ddcb7b110_1c0c7cba_1280.jpg" width=95%" alt="Gojo-Satoru"></div>
    <p>Comic Book Resources regarded Gojo as the 9th most mature character in the series despite his childish personality which is why they found the character highly lovable within the manga's readers. In another article, the same site regarded him as one of the series' most dangerous members due to his over-the-top powers that cannot be rivaled by anyone else in the manga. IGN also called Gojo as a fan-favorite character due to the focus of his personality. StudyBreak also noted that Gojo's flamboyant personality often comes across fitting comic relief, citing how he reacts to Fushiguro being hit by a woman as well as how impressive is he shown to be in combat to a major threat.<br><br>

        Despite comparing him to other mentor characters like Kakashi Hatake, All Might or Aizawa, Bleeding Cool said Gojo remains as more likable within this archetype as a result of how "The character is truly a balance of caring coldness with power that keeps dismissing any serious threats", particularly for how caring he is to his students and the might he shows in battle sequences. An article about the character's best ten fight scenes was also written by Comic Book Resources with his fight against Jogo, being not only the best rated fight he has been involved, but also the series' best fight. Like Comic Book Resources, Anime News Network praised the fight scene Gojo has against Jogo for the handling of visuals, finding it far superior to the studio's previous work The God of High School referred by the staff as "irredeemable trash" not only due to the narrative but also pacing in handling Gojo's fight sequence, making the anime adaptation of Jujutsu Kaisen develop its potential in the process. While still finding Gojo as an archetype due to the overpowered he is portrayed as, the reviewer still found him enjoyable personality-wise.<br><br>

        The Mary Sue found Gojo's characterization in Jujutsu Kaisen 0 identical to the main series as a result of how he trains the students but still found the pilot helped to further explore his past as a result of his tragic relationship with Geto. Otaquest also noted the similarities as well as how important is the relationship between Gojo and Geto which ends in a way that surprised the main series' readers. Manga News looked forward to more focus about the relationship between Gojo and Geto. Crunchyroll listed Gojo's higher screen time in the animated film adaptation of the manga, citing him as a fan favorite character people would appreciate to see.[38] The character's connection with the late Sugawara no Michizane was kept vague that might generate a future impact in the series by critics especially when Yuta Okkotsu reappears in Jujutsu Kaisen and wonders about their relationship to Sugawara.<br><br>

        Gojo's character has been popular in social focus. Following the anime adaptation of the flashbacks to Geto and Gojo's youth, Polygon's Ana Diaz noticed there were several fans who made dōjinshi stories with them which went viral. In September 2023, leaks of the manga's 236th chapter cause a major controversy online within fans of the series. The contents of the chapter surprised fans so much that they took to social media to react to the new development. At time of publication, the "#GojoSatoru" hashtag was trending on X with more than 11,400 posts. The twist of the chapter led to manga artist Kenjiro Hata go on a hiatus from writing the manga Fly Me to the Moon due to the need of recovering from the "shocking" event.<br><br>

        The character has often been compared with Killua Zoldyck from Hunter × Hunter due to physical and personality similarities. When Mariya Ise was cast to portray the younger Gojo in a flashback from the anime's second season, Hindustan Times said the "meme came to life" as Ise was also popular for voicing Killua and fans were happy with such casting.</p>
