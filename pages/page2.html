    <div class="img3"><img src="../img/ichiyuto.jpg" width=95%" alt="BleachXJjk"></div>
    <p>How often did you think about Bleach and JJk? Have you noticed any similarities between these two anime? In this review I'll try to tell you the similarities between Bleach and JJK and why it isn't bad as you may think. So let's start with main heroes of this series!</p>


    <h2>Main heroes</h2>
    <p>Ichigo Kurosaki and Yuji Itadori are the main characters from anime bleach and jjk being a punish high schooler with a good heart and newfound supernatural gifts. With the first view, these two are similar even in appearance. They both have the same goal in saving their friends. In addition, Ichigo and Yuji have their inner demons inside them. They even have the same teachers - Gojo and Urahara. I've already done the review about that. <a href="page3.html">Check here!</a></p>

    <h2>Worlds of two anime</h2>
    <p>Shinigami are unearthly beings living in a world ruled by a different logic than the World of the   Living. They possess high Reiryoku and a body of Reishi. They are invisible to those without spiritual powers.<br><br>When Souls with exceptional spiritual energy train their bodies, they reach the level of Shinigami. The most talented of them become affiliated with various organizations like the Gotei 13 and the Onmitsukidō. The majority of potential Shinigami are born among the residents of the Seireitei, but in some rare cases are born in the Rukongai.<br><br>Shinigami receive salaries, like workers in the Human World and also earn bounties for defeating Hollows.Retirement from further military duties can occur, though this is rare.<br><br>All Shinigami have vents at their wrists which release their Reiatsu. If they are blocked off, the Shinigami in question would be incinerated by their own Reiatsu from the inside out. If a Shinigami's Saketsu (鎖結, Chain Binding; Viz "Chain") and Hakusui (魄睡, Soul Sleep) are pierced, their spiritual powers are sealed up and they most likely can never regain their lost powers again. <br><br>Hollows (虚ホロウ, Horō) are a race of creatures which are born from Human souls who, for various reasons, do not cross over to Soul Society after their death and stay in the Human World for too long. They are corrupt spirits with supernatural powers which devour the souls of both living and deceased Humans. Hollows settle in Hueco Mundo, but can cross over to the Human World and Soul Society. Hollows are the opposite of Humans.</p>
    <p>Jujutsu Sorcerers (呪じゅ術じゅつ師し Jujutsu?) are individuals secretly trained and employed by the government in Japan to defend humanity from cursed spirits.<br><br>The race of humans capable of using jujutsu are colloquially known as Sorcerers (術じゅつ師し Jutsushi?), and the jujutsu prefix is often used to signify their alignment to Jujutsu High. Jujutsu sorcerers who use their powers for criminal purposes, such as murder, are called Curse Users (呪じゅ詛そ師し Jusoshi?) while humans who cannot use jujutsu are called Non-Sorcerers (非ひ術じゅつ師し Hijutsushi?)<br><br>Cursed Spirits (呪じゅ霊れい Jurei?), or simply Curses (呪のろい Noroi?), are a race of spiritual beings invisible to humans, incarnated from the cursed energy that leaks out of humans over time due to their negative emotions. Cursed spirits haunt and bring harm to humanity and are consequently the primary targets of jujutsu sorcerers and their exorcist work.<br><br></p>
    <p>As you can see curses and hollows and shinigami with sorcerers are very similar between them.</p>

    <h2>Villains</h2>
    <p>Kenjaku (羂けん索じゃく Kenjaku?) is one of the primary antagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is an ancient curse user who has existed for over a thousand years using his innate technique, which allows him to transplant his brain into other people to control them. He has inhabited different individuals throughout the centuries and assumed their identities.[2][3] Among those he has possessed include the blight of the Kama clan who created the Cursed Womb: Death Paintings, Noritoshi Kama,[3] the mother of Yuji Itadori, Kaori Itadori, and Suguru Geto, whose corpse Kenjaku is currently possessing to exploit his Cursed Spirit Manipulation.</p>
    <p>Ryomen Sukuna (両りょう面めん宿すく儺な Ryōmen Sukuna?), more often referred to as simply Sukuna (宿すく儺な Sukuna?), is the strongest jujutsu sorcerer from a thousand years ago. Regarded as the undisputed King of Curses (呪のろいの王おう Noroi no Ō?), Sukuna is one of the primary antagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. <br><br>According to legend, Sukuna was an Imaginary Demon (仮か想そうの鬼き神じん Kasō no Kijin?) during the Heian Era but in truth he was a sorcerer also known as the Disgraced One (堕だ天てん Daten?). Jujutsu sorcerers of the Golden Age of Jujutsu gave their all against him but ultimately fell one after another. Sukuna existed throughout the ages by transforming into a cursed object after death, a state where he split his power into twenty indestructible fingers.<br><br>Sukuna was incarnated in June 2018 when Yuji Itadori consumed one of his fingers. Sukuna was trapped inside Yuji's body and was rarely in control until he managed to transfer his soul into the body of Megumi Fushiguro.</p>
    <p>Sōsuke Aizen (藍染 惣右介, Aizen Sōsuke) is the former captain of the 5th Division in the Gotei 13. He later leaves Soul Society with his followers, Gin Ichimaru and Kaname Tōsen. His lieutenant was Momo Hinamori. He formerly served as the lieutenant of the 5th Division under Shinji Hirako. After waging war against Soul Society with an army of Arrancar, Aizen was defeated by Ichigo Kurosaki and sealed away by Kisuke Urahara, and then imprisoned for his crimes.</p>
    <p>Yhwach (ユーハバッハ, Yūhabahha), often referred to simply as "Your Majesty" (陛下, Heika) by his underlings, is the Father of the Quincy (滅却師クインシーの父, Kuinshī no Chichi) and the emperor of the Wandenreich, with the designation A: The Almighty.He is the son of the Soul King.</p>
    <p>As you can see, even the main villains are extremely similar. Kenjaku copies Aizen, and Sukuna copies Yhwach</p>
